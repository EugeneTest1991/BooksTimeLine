By then, the new \"safety\" bicycle had become a national craze, and millions of sturdy two-wheelers were being produced to satisfy this new American craving for speed, freedom, and convenience. Since both brothers were considered not only excellent bicyclists but also the best bicycle mechanics in West Dayton, this new business opportunity became suddenly obvious to them. In 1897 when this photo of Wilbur working at the lathe was taken, the brothers had expanded their bicycle business beyond sales and repair to the design and manufacture of their own line of hand-built, made-to-order bicycles. The Wrights remained in the bicycle business until 1907 and it was successful enough to provide them with the income that they needed to cover all of their aeronautical work.</p>",

They designed the wing based on data from extensive airfoil tests conducted on a homemade wind tunnel. They built many of the components of the glider in Dayton, but they completed assembly at their Kitty Hawk camp in September of 1902. They began testing on September 19. Over the next five weeks, they made between 700 and 1000 glide flights (as estimated by the brothers, who did not keep detailed records of these tests). The longest of these was 622.5 ft (189.7 m) in 26 seconds.</p><p>In 1903 when the brothers tested their powered machine, they brought the 1902 glider out of storage and flew it again to hone their piloting skills before the powered Flyer was ready. The glider went back into storage at the camp when the brothers returned home for Christmas. When they next visited Kitty Hawk in 1908 to test their improved Flyer III, the storage shed had collapsed and the glider inside was wrecked.</p>",

Wilbur traveled to England and France in May 1907 and was joined in July by Orville and later by Charles E. Taylor, their mechanic. The latest version of the plane was shipped to Le Havre in anticipation of demonstrations, and a series of talks began with European agents, discussions that the Wrights hoped would lead to a sales commitment. But negotiations soon collapsed, as would-be European competitors were by then building and flying their own machines. The Continental aviators received so much public acclaim for their short flights that the Wrights seemed likely to lose the recognition they deserved for being first to fly. The Wright brothers did, however, sign an agreement with Flint & Co. and Hart O. Berg, an American engineer, to act as sole agents for the the brothers' abroad and to negotiate agreements with governments for purchase or use of Wright machines and formation of companies to take over ownership or exploitation of the brothers' inventions.",

				"description":   "<p>From Wikipedia: Significantly, this patent illustrated a non-powered flying machineвЂ”namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that wing-warping need not be the only method that could be employed to vary the angle presented to the air by the outer portions of a machine's wings. The concept of varying the angle near the wingtips, by whatever means, is central to the patent. The broad protection intended by this language succeeded when the Wrights won patent infringement lawsuits against Glenn Curtiss and other early aviators, who adopted ailerons while the Wrights continued to use wing-warping. The courts decided that ailerons were also covered by the patent (see Patent War section below). The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when trying to turn the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.</p>",
